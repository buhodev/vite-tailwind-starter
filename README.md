# Vite + Tailwind CSS + Prettier starter template

This starter template comes with:

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) for "Next Generation Frontend Tooling".
- Only HTML & CSS, no Javascript (to use JS, just uncomment the script tag inside `src/index.html` and create a `main.js` file inside the `src/` directory).
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) for rapid prototyping.
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) + Tailwind CSS [plugin](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/prettier-plugin-tailwindcss) for formatting & automatically sorting classes based on the recommended class order.
- Inter variable font included with [optimizations](https://leerob.io/blog/fonts) to prevent layout shift.
- Sensible defaults in the `tailwind.config.js` to create a custom design system for your project.

## Get started

First, download the template.

```bash
pnpx degit buhodev/vite-tailwind-starter my-tailwind-app
```

Then, go inside the folder and install dependencies.

```bash
cd my-tailwind-app
pnpm install
```

After installing your dependencies, start the development server. The `--open` option opens the link in your browser automatically.

```bash
pnpm dev --open
```

To sort your Tailwind CSS classes & format your HTML, run:

```bash
pnpm format
```

## Build for production

When you are ready, upload the `/dist` folder generated by the `build` command. Do not use the `preview` command in production to serve your website (it's meant to be used to preview your build on development mode only).

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm preview
```
